								<p>The benefit that ISO certification brings to Eastern Communications' corporate clients is the assurance of quality in its telecommunication solutions. Carrying the ISO 9001:2008 mark also signifies to Eastern’s clients that the company adheres to quality standards and world-class processes.</p>
								<p>To get the certification, each division had to pass through a series of audits and inspections of their business processes and quality assurance programs. The audit was done by TUV SUD, a leading one-stop global solution provider for product quality testing, inspections, training, and certification.</p>
								<p>The audits showed that corporate goals and strategies are communicated throughout the organization and each division defines how they contribute to achieve the company’s objectives. The inspection also revealed that Eastern’s business processes are sufficiently documented, deployed, and complied. More importantly, the deliverables of employees are communicated, measured, and tracked.</p>
								<p>Eastern Communications now stands for quality within the telecommunications industry in the country. The ISO certification testifies to the company’s ability to deliver superior customer satisfaction through quality service. Importantly, it reflects the company’s vision of being the most preferred telco wherever its services are present and the company’s culture of service excellence and operational responsiveness.</p>
