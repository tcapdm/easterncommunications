					<p>EASTERN Communications, the most preferred business-grade internet provider of the biggest industry players in the country, continues to strengthen its presence and build solid connections with the communities as it opens a new year of service. Hitting the ground running this January, Eastern Communications had prepared a string of events that have not only allowed the company to reach out to their clientele but also gave them fun activities that are worth savoring.</p>
					<p>And because it is also the company's priority to engage and have fun with the communities it serves, Eastern Communications reveled with the fun-loving Cebuanos during the grandest festival of tradition, culture, and religiosity: The Sinulog Festival. Eastern Communications added more hype to the celebration and gave Sinulog revelers more reasons to hit the streets and shout out their devotion to the Holy Child Jesus.</p>
					<p>Eastern Communications had been witness to the jubilant happenings that transpired along Osmeña Boulevard as they had put up their booth in front of Crown Regency Hotel during the Sinulog Grand Parade last January 17. But instead of having a typical tent-tables-and-chairs set-up of a booth, Eastern Communication dressed up their spot as a homey lounge for their clients. The booth served as a go-to spot for revelers to slow down a bit, sit down, and chill for a while with some refreshments on the side in the midst of the hustle and bustle of the celebration. They also gave out awesome freebies like foldable fans that proved very useful for revelers to combat heat while enjoying the activities on the streets.</p>
					<p>As a subsidiary entity owned by San Miguel Group of Companies, Eastern Communications joined the San Miguel Beer Night, a party and concert that allowed Sinulog revelers to sing to the beats of Original Pinoy Music until late at night last January 16 at the Fuente Osmeña Circle. Popular bands Itchyworms and SpongeCola played their hits while entertaining the revelers who were aching for live concert music. What&apos;s more, selected participants were in for a treat as Eastern Communications gave out  gift items that added more fun to the celebration.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Eastern Communications was also present during the Sinulog Central: Food &amp; Lifestyle Bazaar held last January 15 to 17 at Ayala Center Cebu. The three-day bazaar, which had been a great venue for different brands to boast of their products, was a showcase of mostly Cebuano delicacies, clothing, and accessories.</p>
					<p>All these activities are anchored on Eastern Communications&apos; purpose of drawing the brand and its wide range of services to its diverse networks of clientele. &quot;Eastern Communications would like to thank our Cebuano partners and clients for welcoming and celebrating with us this year&apos;s Sinulog Festival, and for their continued trust and patronage. We hope to be part of the festival again next year and all the years to come, and make our participation even bigger and more exciting,&quot; said Eastern Communications&apos; Marketing Services Head Jed Estanislao.
